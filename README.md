#### The Way of Unix-Nature

"How do I learn Linux," asked the intern, "so that I may join the ranks of professional developers?"

"Linux is but a kernel," replied Master Foo. "It no more teaches Unix-nature than swinging a sword teaches metallurgy."

"But Unix is ancient," argued the intern, "it's impractical to use something so old. All the developers I know use Linux."

Master Foo nodded in agreement. "Developers use Linux because it most adequately allows them to write software in accordance with the philosophy of Unix. But such development does not require Unix, or Linux, for that matter, so long as Unix-nature permeates each line of code, each docstring, each commit."

Master Foo pressed "Rewind," and a Vim terminal flashed onto the screen. "There is more Unix-nature in one line of YaML than there is in ten thousand lines of Golang."

"Sorry, let me rephrase," said the intern. "I wish to learn Unix-nature by installing and using Linux. Which distro should I download?"

Master Foo pulled an Arch image onto a USB stick and handed it to the intern.

The intern bowed and left. He returned the next day, angry with Master Foo. "Arch sucks. It doesn't do anything. It's just a terminal."

Master Foo shrugged. "The Unix-nature is simple and empty. Because it is simple and empty, it is more powerful than a typhoon. Moving in accordance with the law of nature, it unfolds inexorably in the minds of programmers, assimilating designs to its own nature. All software that would compete with it must become like to it; empty, empty, profoundly empty, perfectly void."

"So I should write all the code myself?" asked the intern. "That's how I'll learn to program?"

Master Foo struck the intern with his cane. "Who better understands Unix-nature? Is it he who writes ten thousand lines of Golang, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by not coding? Reusability is Unix-nature! Your first task is simply to reuse the work of other developers: `pacman -S gnome`! Continue along this path until one day, others reuse your work. On that day, remember two things: first, the profound void that awaited your instructions, and second, how simple your first instruction was. Spend the rest of your career trying to build software even emptier and even simpler.
